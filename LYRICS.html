Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive, we're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away

At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shining bright like a diamond

We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shine bright like a diamond (whoa)
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
